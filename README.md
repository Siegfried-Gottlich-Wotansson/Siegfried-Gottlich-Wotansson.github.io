- My site -
Pedagogical, Scientific, Philosophical and Aesthetic Softwares, a place of learning; I intend it to become a platform peer-to-peer Webhosting with thousands of different courses and that releases news over most if not all subjects that matter. Open Source - the courses included - if and only if one cannot pay for them - the rest could pay from 5 to 200 dollars or the equivalent in virtual coins -.
